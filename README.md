# T3SS-Heterogeneity
This is the repository for MatLab scripts contributing to Christina Lin and Daniel Lee's research on studying the dynamics of T3SS expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The scripts manipulate output files from Oufti, created by the Jacobs-Wagner lab and restructured by Casey Grun (github.com/caseygrun/oufti).
The scripts require MatLab 2018 version (or above) to run. Oufti from Casey Grun requires MatLab 2014b to run, and is currently optimized to work on Macs (to be updated).

This README will be updated with script filenames and their purpose.
